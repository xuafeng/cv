## about
I am a researcher at [Microsoft Research Asia â€“ Vancouver Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/microsoft-research-asia-vancouver/) working on bridging the gap between general artificial intelligenceâ€¯and its real-world applications, specifically work on designing next-generation agent system. Previously, I am a security researcher at the [Trustworthy Systems group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/trustworthy-systems-asia/) in the Systems and Networking research area at [Microsoft Research Asia - Beijing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). I received my Ph.D. in [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/) (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in July 2020. I visited [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) as a visiting scholar (supervised by Prof. XiaoFeng Wang) in 2018.

My research interests include  _Furture Agent System, AI for system, AI for operational/defensive security_, with the specific focus on using a AI-driven approach to identify and address system problems, security problem, and any other real-world impactful problems. I am interested in proposing new methods or building AI-powered tools to empower your daily productivity.

Feel free to reach me at xuafeng (at) microsoft.com, if you have questions. Thanks :)

## projects

**AI for Security**. My Ph.D. research focused on using AI techniques (NLP) to enhance operational security in IoT domains. With the new AI technologies (LLM) emerging, I realized that there is a great potential to apply them for more broader security areas. Some of my recent explorations include:

+ LLM for Asset Discovery: leverage LLM to write rules for device discovery (w/ MS Defender EASM/MDE)
+ LLM for Bot Detection: leverage LLM to label bot accounts accessing MS Copilot (w/ MS Copilot)
+ LLM for OSINT Processing: leverage LLM to write production quality TI reports (w/ MDTI, Sentinel, EASM and Security Copilot)
+ LLM for Static Analysis: leverage LLM for C/C++ UaF vulnerability detection.
+ Secure PowerShell Generation: leverage LLM to generate secure PowerShell scripts.

**AI for System**. I am also interested in using AI techniques to address challenging system problems. Current AI can now write codeâ€”but not systems. It lacks the capacity to reason about architecture, trade-offs, and timeless design principles. Enabling AI to design systems is a critical step toward unlocking its next stage of capabilities. We are activately working on pursing systems intelligence.
