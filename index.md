### About

I am a security researcher at the Trustworthy Systems group in the Systems and Networking research area at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). I received my Ph.D. in [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/) (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 2020. 
I visited Indiana University Bloomington as a visiting scholar in 2018.

My research interests include IoT security, cyber security, and network measurements, with the specific focus on using a data-driven approach to study threats, weakness, and abuse on network/IoT devices at global scale. 
I am interested in proposing new methods or building tools to discover and secure exposed vulnerable network/IoT devices. Hoping our research can improve the security of the Internet’s core infrastructure or guide the design/deployment of widely used systems.

Feel free to reach me at xuafeng (at) microsoft.com, if you have questions or find errors. Thanks :)
